# Natural Language Processing Specialization

[DeepLearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) contains four courses which can be taken on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing). The four courses are:

1. [Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp)
2. [Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-models-in-nlp)
3. [Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp)
4. [Natural Language Processing with Attention Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp)


## About This Specialization (From the official NLP Specialization page)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

- By the end of this Specialization, one is ready to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even build chatbots. These and other NLP applications are going to be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.

- This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. ≈Åukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.
